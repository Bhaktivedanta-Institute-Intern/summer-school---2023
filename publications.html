                Both science and spirituality aim to understand various aspects of nature and the Ultimate Reality through diverse approaches. 
                Science deals with physicality and attempts to explain them in a mathematical framework. Spirituality, on the other hand, 
                entails knowledge of the self, the Supreme, and their relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the well-being of humanity, if science works by harnessing the properties of matter; spirituality, on the other hand, is a 
                user manual for proper utilization of the gifts of God including the self. Both science and spirituality have coexisted 
                perpetually, although the manifestation of one has been more pronounced than the other. A true scientist acknowledges the 
                importance of spirituality, and a true spiritualist also appreciates scientific discoveries as of the “works of the God.”
            </p>
            <p>
                At present times, the gap between science and spirituality was very much widened. It is to be bridged to bring harmony in the 
                self, the society, the nation, and the world. All the publications mentioned below are having numerous informative & 
                enlightening articles by World-renowned Scientists, Nobel laureates in this direction for deeper explorations of some of the 
                fundamental questions.

            <h3><b>Consciousness:</b></h3>
            <p>
                Consciousness or being conscious is part of our everyday life, every minute. We know we have
                consciousness but we do not
                know about it - What is it? From where does it arise or is it itself a fundamental aspect of reality?
                Consciousness is a
                mystery for all of us even after decades of advancement in the natural sciences and medical field. The
                author, Dr. T. D.
                Singh, is one of the renowned personalities, a pioneer and visionary who gave a new start to this field
                of consciousness
                and was instrumental in bringing consciousness under scientific investigation. He launched the ‘First
                International
                Conference on the Study of Consciousness within Science’ in 1990 at San Francisco, California. From
                neuroscientists to
                quantum physicists to psychologists including two Nobel Laureates, he brought together the most eminent
                minds on a
                common table for a serious dialogue. Dr. Singh, who underwent rigorous practice both as a firm scientist
                and as a
                profound Vedantist, has brought out some of the most precious and deeper aspects of this mystery of
                consciousness in
                this volume.

            <h3><b>Mysticism:</b></h3>
            <p>
                We are surrounded by mountains of unlimited mysteries. In any discipline, if one goes a little deeper,
                he encounters
                myriads of mystical elements. Starting from the question about the existence of cute imaginary numbers
                (are they really
                imaginary?) in mathematics, to the meaning of incomprehensible wavefunction in physics and the
                inaccessible origin of
                life in the life-sciences, just to name a few, we cannot escape mysteries around us. In fact, the
                developments of modern
                itself over the last four centuries have even opened them wider before us, as never before. In his
                spiritual journey, a
                mystic also encounters mysteries at every step and looks for answers. What are the various mysteries in
                physics,
                mathematics, life-sciences or cosmology? How does a scientist or a mystic encounter them? What paths
                does he take to
                move ahead? What guides his journey and what is the future of such a seeker? Explore these and more in
                this extremely
                precious publication, Mysticism- A Meeting Point of Science and Religion, with one of the most brilliant
                scientist and
                saint of our times, Dr. T. D. Singh Dr. Singh, who had a firsthand experience of both, with his Ph.D. in
                Physical

            <p>
                Since antiquity, many prominent thinkers of the world, from Plato to Tagore and from Newton to Einstein,
                have attempted
                to unveil the nature of reality. But reality seems always deeper than our feeble minds can comprehend.
                Can a combined
                effort of science and spirituality, the two most dominant forces of humanity, help to delve deeper into
                the nature of
                reality? This unique dialogue between Dr. T. D. Singh and Sir Roger Penrose; like the well-known
                East-West dialogue
                between Tagore and Einstein, is a sincere attempt to seek some possible answers to the question of
                reality. Reflecting
                on a wide range of topics from consciousness to cosmology and from scientific mystery to mathematical
                beauty, this
                dialogue will provide readers with useful insights in their quest for the ultimate reality. The volume

            <p>
                Starting with the thoughts of the Founding Fathers of Quantum Physics in their own words in the first
                section, where one
                will find unheard-before conclusions drawn by these renowned thinkers of all times from the mysteries of
                quantum
                physics, the book in its second section takes us further into conclusions drawn by some of the
                contemporary renowned
                scholars of our times, such as Wigner’s emphatic article on consciousness in modern physics, various
                paradigm shifts
                coming in science by Amit Goswami, analyzing state-of-art in various experiments attempted for quantum
                mechanics in
                recent times by Nobel Laureate in Physics A J Leggett and the central role of observer and free will in
                physics by
                Zurich in-depth physicist Antonie Suarez.
            </p>

            <p>
                The third section focuses on possible connections between quantum physics and life; between physics and
                psychology, as
                Pauli and Wigner desired long ago, whereas section four traverses one more step and enters possible
                connections of
                quantum physics with spiritual wisdom and its theistic interpretations.

                Since the dawn of civilization, all philosophical, scientific, religious and even artistic works, in
                principle, have
                centered around the study of life, its meaning and the origin of the universe. What is life? What is the
                origin of the
                universe? Is there any meaning and purpose behind the manifestation of life and the universe? What is
                the unseen cause
                behind the manifestation of the perceivable universe? These questions have puzzled all the great
                thinkers around the
                world over the ages. Vedanta, the topmost scientific and philosophical treatise of Indian spiritual and
                cultural
                heritage has a lot to contribute in this area and could provide a vital leap in expanding our knowledge
                of life and the
                origin of the universe. In this unique book, His Holiness Bhaktisvarupa Damodara Swami (Dr. T. D. Singh)
                investigates
                life and the secrets of the origin of the universe and depicts the relevance of Vedantic wisdom in the
                context of modern
                scientific and technological developments. His Holiness, who is both a scientist with a Ph. D. in
                Physical Organic
                Chemistry from the University of California, Irvine, USA and a spiritualist in the Bhakti-Vedanta
                tradition of India,
                has been one of the pioneers in advancing the science and religion dialogue for over thirty years. His
                writings,
                investigating a profound relationship between science and spirituality in the search for a deeper
                understanding of life and the universe will provide useful insights
                in the search for the Ultimate Reality
