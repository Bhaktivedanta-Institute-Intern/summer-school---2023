                            <strong>Description: </strong>
                            Consciousness or being conscious is part of our everyday life, every minute. We know we have
                            consciousness but we do not know about it - What is it? From where does it arise or is it
                            itself a fundamental aspect of reality? Consciousness is a mystery for all of us even after
                            decades of advancement in the natural sciences and medical field. The author, Dr. T. D.
                            Singh, is one of the renowned personalities, a pioneer and visionary who gave a new start to
                            this field of consciousness and was instrumental in bringing consciousness under scientific
                            investigation. He launched the ‘First International Conference on the Study of Consciousness
                            within Science’ in 1990 at San Francisco, California. From neuroscientists to quantum
                            physicists to psychologists including two Nobel Laureates, he brought together the most
                            eminent minds on a common table for a serious dialogue. Dr. Singh, who underwent rigorous
                            practice both as a firm scientist and as a profound Vedantist, has brought out some of the
                            most precious and deeper aspects of this mystery of consciousness in this volume.

                            Since antiquity, many prominent thinkers of the world, from Plato to Tagore and from Newton
                            to
                            Einstein,
                            have attempted
                            to unveil the nature of reality. But reality seems always deeper than our feeble minds can
                            comprehend.
                            Can a combined
                            effort of science and spirituality, the two most dominant forces of humanity, help to delve
                            deeper into
                            the nature of
                            reality? This unique dialogue between Dr. T. D. Singh and Sir Roger Penrose; like the
                            well-known
                            East-West dialogue
                            between Tagore and Einstein, is a sincere attempt to seek some possible answers to the
                            question
                            of
                            reality. Reflecting
                            on a wide range of topics from consciousness to cosmology and from scientific mystery to
                            mathematical
                            beauty, this
                            dialogue will provide readers with useful insights in their quest for the ultimate reality.

                            quantum
                            physics, the book in its second section takes us further into conclusions drawn by some of
                            the
                            contemporary renowned
                            scholars of our times, such as Wigner’s emphatic article on consciousness in modern physics,

                            centered around the study of life, its meaning and the origin of the universe. What is life?
                            What is the
                            origin of the
                            universe? Is there any meaning and purpose behind the manifestation of life and the
                            universe?
                            What is
                            the unseen cause

                            great
                            thinkers around the
