                      <br> <br>

                      In 2020, Earl Miller was awarded an honorary doctorate (Doctor of Science, honoris causa) from Kent State University.
                      <br> <br>

                      Earl Miller received a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Kent State University in 1985,
                      Master of Arts degree
                      in psychology and neuroscience from Princeton University in 1987, and a PhD in psychology and
                      neuroscience from
                      Princeton University in 1990 under the supervision of the late Professor Charles G. Gross. He was
                      a post-doctoral fellow
                      in the laboratory of neuropsychology at the National Institute of Mental Health under the
                      supervision of Robert Desimone
                      from 1990 to 1995. In 1995, Earl Miller joined the faculty of the Department of Brain and
                      Cognitive Sciences at MIT as
                      an Assistant Professor of Neuroscience.
                      <br><br>
                      His research is based on studying neural mechanisms of attention, learning, and memory needed for
                      voluntary
                      goal-oriented behavior. His work also explores prefrontal function by employing various techniques
                      including
                      multiple-electrode neurophysiology, psychophysics, pharmacological manipulations, and
                      computational techniques.

                      Professor Miller is the recipient of a variety of awards and serves as editor, and on the
                      editorial boards of major
                      journals in neuroscience, and on international advisory boards. His paper with Jonathan Cohen,
                      (Miller and Cohen, 2001),
                      which presented a new framework for understanding the prefrontal cortex, ranks fifth all-time in

                      Prof. Mayank Mehta is Professor at University of California, Los Angeles. He is affiliated to the

                      The mind is believed to be an emergent property of the actions of ensembles of neurons in his
                      novel approach to memory
                      studies. It is uncertain what these emergent features are and how they develop. His research
                      focuses on this. One of the
                      areas in which his team works to learn more is the method by which ensembles of neurons encode
                      information about the
                      physical world. Understanding how the brain perceives space-time and how these neural
                      representations change as we learn
                      is necessary for this. His group investigates how sleep affects learning using cutting-edge
                      methods. He focuses on
                      creating the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) that is based on the human brain and
                      non-invasive,
                      reversible ways to turn on/off specific brain regions. In addition, he studies how individual
                      neurons respond to virtual
                      reality and how information is processed by neurons as they sleep to generate long-lasting
                      memories. His findings would
                      not only offer a fundamental knowledge of the dynamics of neuronal ensembles, but they would also
                      suggest brand-new
                      approaches to treating learning and memory problems. In order to comprehend how animals perceive
                      space, he employs
                      virtual reality. The theories put forth by Prof. Mayank Mehta demonstrate how virtual reality
                      might enhance healthy
                      brain rhythms by changing neuronal dynamics, circuitry, and plasticity.

                      Neil Burgess was born in 1966. He is a Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College
                      London and Principal
                      Research Fellow for the Wellcome Trust. He has developed computational models that link behaviour
                      to activity in
                      biological brain networks, making significant contributions to our knowledge of memory and spatial
                      cognition.
                      <br><br>
                      Burgess received his education at University College London (UCL), where he studied mathematics
                      and physics as an
                      undergraduate. He finished his doctoral education in theoretical physics at the University of
                      Manchester's School of
                      Physics and Astronomy under the direction of Michael A. Moore, where he started collaborating with
                      Graham Hitch on
                      memory model research and received a Doctorate in 1990.
                      <br><br>
                      Neuroscience studies by Burgess have created models that describe how neural networks enable us to
                      represent, recall,
                      and visualise our location within the surrounding environment. These models offer a mathematical
                      insight of how human
                      brain activity affects the function (and malfunction) of spatial memory, episodic memory, and
                      autobiographical memory.
                      Along with Colin Lever and Tom Hartley of Durham University and the University of York, he both
                      anticipated and
                      discovered neurons that encode environmental boundaries.
                      <br><br>
                      Burgess held a Royal Society University Research Fellowship prior to being elected a Fellow of the
                      Royal Society (FRS)
                      in 2017 and a Member of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 2009

                          Technology Kharagpur, India. His research involves multiscale and  multiphysics modeling of electrochemical energy storage systems. As part of his 
                          research he uses Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) to obtain various physical parameters of atomic scale and transfer them to 
                          the continuum scale models to explore better battery designs with improved performance. Before joining PhD he obtained MS (by Research) degree in 
                          materials engineering from IIT KGP.
