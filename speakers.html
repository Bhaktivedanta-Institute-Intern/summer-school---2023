                          Harvard University since 2003 and Director of the Haravad’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics.  He is one of the leading researchers in 
                          the field that studies the role of cooperation in evolution. In 1989, he earned his doctorate in biochemistry and mathematics from the 
                          University of Vienna with thesis on quasispecies theory and evolution of cooperation. From 1989-1998, he was Erwin Schrodinger Postdoctoral 
                          Scholar at University of Oxford. He held professorships at University of Oxford and IAs, Princeton before moving to Harvard in 2003. 
                          His research interests include evolution of cooperation, evolution of language, evolutionary game theory and graph theory, somatic 
                          evolution of cancer, the dynamics of viruses and infectious diseases, pre-life and origins of life.
                          <br>
                          He is famous for his proposal and works in showing evolution requires third component called “cooperation” inaddition to the classical 
                          components of mutation and natural selection. Among his major discoveries are the mechanism of HIV disease progression, the first 
                          mathematical approach for studying the evolution of human language, the first quantification of the in vivo kinetics of human cancer 
                          and the five rules for the evolution of cooperation. He has published over 300 papers in world’s leading scientific journals including 
                          several in Nature and Science. He is a highly cited researcher with an h-index of 159. He authored many well-received books including 
                          Virus Dynamics (2000); Evolutionary Dynamics (2006); Super Cooperators (2011) and Evolution, Games & God (2013). He is a corresponding 
                          member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. For his outstanding works, he received several international recognitions including Oxford’s 
                          Weldon Memorial Prize; the Albert Wander Prize of University of Bern; the Akira Okabo Prize of the Society for Mathematical Biology; the 
                          David Starr Jordan Prize jointly awarded by Oxford, Cornell and Indiana Universities and the Henry Dale Prize of the Royal Institution of

                          research he uses Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) to obtain various physical parameters of atomic scale and transfer them to 
                          the continuum scale models to explore better battery designs with improved performance. Before joining PhD he obtained MS (by Research) degree in
