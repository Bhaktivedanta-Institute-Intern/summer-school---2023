              Earl K. Miller is the Picower Professor of Neuroscience in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received his B.A. (summa cum laude, with honors) in Psychology from Kent State University in 1985.  He received an M.A. (in 1987) and Ph.D. (in 1990) in Psychology and Neuroscience from Princeton University.  Professor Miller was awarded an honorary doctorate (Doctor of Science, honoris causa) from Kent State University in 2020.Professor Miller studies the neural basis of executive brain functions, the ability to carry out goal-directed behavior using complex mental processes.  Research topics include working memory, attention, decision-making, and learning.  The Miller Lab has shown how categories and concepts are learned, how multifunctional “mixed-selectivity” neurons endow the cortex with computational horsepower and flexibility, and how neural oscillations regulate neural communication and consciousness.  This work has established a foundation upon which to construct more detailed, mechanistic accounts of cognition and its dysfunction in diseases such as autism, schizophrenia, and attention deficit disorder.

              The mind is thought to be the emergent property of the activities of ensembles of neurons. The nature of these emergent properties and how they arise are unknown. This is the focus of our research. In particular, our current research addresses the following fundamental questions in Neurophysics:
              1. How is information about the physical world represented by ensembles of neurons? In particular, what are the neural mechanisms of perceiving space-time?
              2. How do the neural representations evolve with learning?
              3. What is the role of brain rhythms in learning and memory?
              4. How does sleep influence learning?
              To address these questions we use both experimental and theoretical approaches as follows: 
              1. Develop hardware to measure and manipulate neural activity and behavior.
              2. Measure the activity of ensembles of well isolated neurons from many hippocampal and neocortical areas simultaneously during learning and during sleep.
              3. Develop data analysis tools to decipher the patterns of neural activity and field potentials, and their relationship to behavior.

              I am based at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and affiliated to the UCL Institute of Neurology, Department of Epilepsy, the Wellcome Centre for Human NeuroImaging and the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour. I am supported by a Wellcome Principal Research Fellowship and ERC Advanced Grant NEUROMEM.I'm interested in the neural mechanisms supporting memory, with particular interest in the role of the hippocampus in spatial and episodic memory, but also an interest in the role of other brain regions and forms of memory such as phonological working memory. My approach is to develop models relating the actions of individual neurons to behaviour so as to integrate results from single unit recording, neuropsychological and functional neuroimaging and behavioural experiments. I hope to both predict and perform useful experiments and to generate novel theoretical and computational well-specified understanding of the mechanisms involved.My research has followed 4 main directions: Developing quantitative simulations of the computation role of hippocampal neurons in rat navigation (reviewed here), and of where and how grid cells (like this model) and place cells will fire in new environments. I am currently interested to extend these well-grounded models to capture the characteristics of human spatial and episodic memory, attempting to integrate the experimental results below. Identifying the environmental inputs determining the receptive fields of hippocampal place cells, examining how these responses change with experience, and showing how the temporal and rate code of place cell firing is independent.  
              The third strand of my research concerns the neural basis of navigation and episodic memory in humans, using virtual reality environments based on modifications of PC video games. These have been used in behavioural, functional neuroimaging and Neuropsychological studies, focussing on the hippocampus and related structures.I am also interested in modelling working memory for serial order and its relationship to long term memory, including the relationship between imagery and memory and the role of parietal, medial temporal and frontal areas in these processes. of the hippocampus.

             Prof.Dayashri Sharma laboratory is involved in the study of neuropathogenesis of murine Coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection which causes central nervous system (CNS) demyelination and consecutive axonal loss and mimics certain pathology of human neurological disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Demyelination is the process by which axons lose their normal insulating myelin. Myelin forms an insulating sheath surrounding axons in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is essential for rapid propagation of neuronal action potentials. Our laboratory is focused to understand the genomic control of disease phenotype of the MHV strains to empathize the cellular and molecular mechanism of viral induced demyelinaiton in experimental animal model of MS, where we are investigating; 1) how acute viral infection initiate innate immune activation in the CNS which in turn can lead to chronic demyelination with or without involving the adaptive immune system; 2) whether cleavage and fusion properties of the spike protein plays any role in viral spread and neuronal tropism from gray to white matter and preferential neuronal tropism in the white matter can cause demyelination; 4) whether cell-cell interactions in the CNS through gap junction plays any role in neuroinflammatory cascade of MHV induced demyelination. In order to conduct these investigations, we have the important tools of a well developed animal model system and reverse genetic systems of MHV with which to manipulate the viral genome. Our lab has extensive experience in making recombinant strains, phenotypic and pathological characterization of recombinant strains, including fusion, spread to neural tissues and differential neural cell tropism of isogenic recombinant strains in brain, spinal cord and optic nerve. We also have expertise in molecular, cellular, and in vitro neuronal cell and glial cell culture techniques required for our investigations. Our combined studies on the correlation between the genomic control of biologic phenotype of the MHV strains with demyelination and axonal pathology of mouse CNS in neuroinflammatory cascade will be able to establish a powerful approach to elucidate the cellular and molecular details regarding the pathogenesis of MHV induced neurological dystrophy. My long term goal is to extend these studies to search for similarities in mechanistic pathways of the inflammatory processes associated with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, and other infectious diseases. The insights from my studies will provide me proper knowledge and expertise to meet the challenge of future emerging neurotropic viruses and viral diseases.

                          Technology Kharagpur, India. His research involves multiscale and  multiphysics modeling of electrochemical energy storage systems. As part of his 
                          research he uses Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) to obtain various physical parameters of atomic scale and transfer them to 
                          the continuum scale models to explore better battery designs with improved performance. Before joining PhD he obtained MS (by Research) degree in 
                          materials engineering from IIT KGP.
